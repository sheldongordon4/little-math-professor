## Description

The **Little Professor** program is a Python-based math quiz generator inspired by the iconic childhood toy. It presents users with 10 randomly generated addition problems, offering an engaging and educational experience tailored to different skill levels.

Designed for simplicity, interaction, and learning reinforcement, the app includes real-time feedback, score tracking, and adjustable difficulty settings.

Key features include:

- **Difficulty Levels**
Users can choose from levels 1, 2, or 3, which scale the number ranges for each problem.
- **Error Feedback**
Users receive "EEE" feedback for incorrect answers and are shown the correct answer after three failed attempts.
- **Score Tracking**
After 10 problems, the program displays the userâ€™s final score out of 10.
- **Robust Input Handling**
Gracefully handles invalid input (e.g., non-integers or unsupported difficulty levels) and prompts re-entry.
